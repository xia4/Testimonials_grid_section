            Such a life-changing

          <p class="sub">
            "Before joining the bootcamp. I've
            never writtem a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
            a former student of theirs about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not
            disapoint. They were very hands-on and
            I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particuler,
            was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level
            in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
            I've often referred to it during interview as an
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job
            as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
            offers. 100% recommend! "
